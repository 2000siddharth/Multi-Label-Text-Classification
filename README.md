# Multi-Label-Text-Classification
Kaggle Toxic Comments Challenge


With continuous increase in available data, there is a pressing need to organize it and modern classification problems often involve the prediction of multiple labels simultaneously associated with a single instance.
Known as Multi-Label Classification, it is one such task which is omnipresent in many real world problems.

In this project, using a Kaggle problem as example, we explore different aspects of multi-label classification.
